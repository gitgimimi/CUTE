    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">He’s always relaxing, lying down, or doing nothing, and that’s exactly what makes him so lovable. With his soft brown fur and sleepy eyes, he gives off a calm and peaceful vibe. Some say Rilakkuma is actually wearing a bear costume, but no one really knows what’s inside. He spends time with his friends Korilakkuma and Kiiroitori. Rilakkuma reminds us that it’s okay to take a break and enjoy the little things in life.</p>
